Sample Service Project - Non-Working Non-Proprietary Work-Based Sample
--------

Over the last two years, I have contributed twice to rails/rails, but most of
my outside work in coding has been about training with Team Treehouse and
CodeSchool, and there weren't projects built through that training. It's been
super-valuable, but it doesn't leave much time for outside coding projects.
With that in mind, I am attempting to illustrate some of the tasks/projects I
accomplished at work--without posting proprietary code. So, this code won't
work. I'm not creating a working app here. Just the key components that show
anyone who might review this repo the sort of things I have built.

A service like this one replaced a task that was a daily occurrence, sent over
from our ops team to the devs, who manually ran a script for each object. Some
days, there might only be three. Other times, there might be 30. Creating this
"self-service" UI allowed ops to make their changes as they happened and
faster, and it eliminated a burdensome task on the dev team. Moreover, the
original intent behind the assignment was to accomplish two key tasks, but in
considering the data we might receive, I included additional features which
turned out to be something the devs could use, too, saving even more time than
originally anticipated.

In the working application, I contributed routes, administrative restrictions,
and some aggregated stylesheets--the one stylesheet I included is the sort that
I would aggregate into an application-wide stylesheet.
